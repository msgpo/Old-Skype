[Microsoft decided to pull the official _old_ Skype 7 version](https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-pulls-installer-for-classic-skype-for-windows-desktop-app-due-to-security-issue), which means users are forced to upgrade to 8.x which is not anymore a Win32 application - it's UWP (SkypeApp 12). Some people might not like this, so I decided to give everyone the chance to get the latest Win32 Version. 

**Goal**
- [x] Give you the chance back to install & use the old Skype version again
- [x] Avoid Malware downloads, this release is verified and the checksums and all needed informations are given
